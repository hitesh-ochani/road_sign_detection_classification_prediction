# Road Sign Depth Prediction

This module includes the code associated with the training and testing of the depth prediction model inspired from SFMLearner () and DispNet. SfMLearner jointly trains single view depth estimation and mutliple view pose estimation models. But, we've separated the depth estimation model from pose estimation and employed it in our project.
